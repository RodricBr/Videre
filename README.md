# + Videre
## - View IP history using [ViewDNS](https://viewdns.info/iphistory/)

<img src="videre.png">

## - Installation
```console
git clone https://github.com/RodricBr/Videre
cd Videre/;chmod u+x videre
./videre exemplo.com
```

> **IMPORTANT:** This program doesn't work at the moment, since viewdns has removed the ability to make requests using curl, or anything else. <br>
> I'll find a way, but for now it doesn't work.
